        <p>About Us</p>
        <p>A personal mission statement and personal vision statement can be used to guide our decision-making and help us stay focused to meet our long-term goals. Company statements are no different. A company vision statement is one of your most important business documents, along with your mission statement and core values. Although it's easy to confuse the three, each one is unique and serves its own purpose. </p>
